## Fix this

- [ ] axios for auth handling
- [ ] Better handling of external (TVDB/TRAKT) API errors
- [ ] Capitalize genres in show page (front end)
- [ ] Episodes in a slider instead of season image in show info page - How to do this effeiciently, lots of episodes and images to load. New endpoint?

## Questions

- [ ] What does `exportPathMap` do?
- [ ] Is the first page the only one that's truly rendered server-side?
- [ ] What is, and how do I set up CORS?
- [ ] How do I quickly get a show image in the front end? Example: random top 10 show image in the banner background.
